# Enhancing GNNs with Architecture-Agnostic Graph Transformations: A Systematic Analysis

This repository contains the source code for my master thesis project, **"Enhancing GNNs with Architecture-Agnostic Graph Transformations: A Systematic Analysis."** It also includes the implementation for the associated paper: [arXiv:2410.08759](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08759).

## Overview

The project explores graph transformations designed to enhance the expressivity and accuracy of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in both synthetic and real-world settings. It provides a systematic analysis of these transformations, which are architecture-agnostic and conserve isomorphism.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites specified in `requirements.txt`

Install all required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
